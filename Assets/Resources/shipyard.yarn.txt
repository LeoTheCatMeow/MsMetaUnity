MsMeta: …amazing. It actually worked!
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling_closed>>
MsMeta: I’m in the past. I traveled through time. And I made it in one piece!
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: Huh. Justice City looks…different in 1942.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: And no sign of Arachdroid anywhere. That’s bad news. What if they’ve already started messing with history?

Max: Well, the fabric of reality hasn’t unravelled yet, so I think we’ve still got breathing room.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling>>
MsMeta: Max!
<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor pleased>>
Max: Hey, Army, this is the year 2020 on the line. Good to hear you’re okay. Any joy yet?
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: No, sorry. There’s no sign of Arachdroid.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: And Justice City looks so different in 1942, I’m not even sure how to get to the old Harbor Shipyard, let alone stop them from interfering in the biggest punch-up in superhero history.
<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
Max: Hang tight. I’ll send you a map.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling>>
MsMeta: You can do that?
<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral>>
Max: Yeah, the prototype Time Engine you got doesn’t have a built-in historical variator like the version Arachdroid stole, so I’ll hard-code you one. I’ll have to account for some mathematical variables based off Grandma’s research on temporal displacement and my own work on P versus NP.

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smirking>>
MsMeta: So long as it gets me where I need to go, I don’t care how it works.
<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor pleased_closed>>
Max: Heh. They teach you that in USACE? Anyway, here it comes.
<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral>>
Max: Press [M] to bring up the map.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad>>
MsMeta: It’s…kind of a mess.
<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
Max: Huh. It…shouldn’t be. I accounted for the Time Engine’s temporal distortion mechanics.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
MsMeta: I’ll see if I can get it working.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling>>
MsMeta: Okay, I think I’ve got it.
<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor smiling>>
Max: Nice work!
<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor smiling>>
Max: Now all you’ve got to do is follow the arrows.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad_speaking>>
MsMeta: What arrows?

MsMeta: It’s one of Arachdroid’s spider drones!

<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
Max: Seriously? What’s it doing?

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
MsMeta: It’s just wandering around…

<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral>>
Max: Oh. I’ve seen that before. ‘Patrol mode’, it’s called. That means Alex must be somewhere nearby.

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad>>
MsMeta: ‘Alex’…you mean Arachdroid.

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: …I’ll try talking to it. Maybe it knows where they are.

MsMeta: Where’s your maker? 
SpiderDrone: …

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad_speaking>>
MsMeta: Whoa! Hold up! We don’t have to fight.

SpiderDrone: DESTROY DESTROY attack DESTROY

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad>>
MsMeta: …okay, so, I guess you think we do have to fight.

MsMeta: It didn’t have to be like this. I hate having to fight robots.

<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor angry>>
Max: Mm. Did it just call you a scrub? I’m gonna have a word with Alex about that.

<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
Max: Once you’ve finished stopping them from destroying reality as we know it, I mean. Priorities.

Max: Hey, Meta, your passive proximity scanner just sent back a ping.

<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral>>
Max: Keep going where you’re going, you’re getting closer to Alex with every step.

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad>>
MsMeta: Uh…about that.

<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
Max: What’s wrong?

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad_speaking>>
MsMeta: If I keep going where I’m going, I’m going to end up walking into the business end of a bayonet.

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor angry_closed>>
MsMeta: On a scale of one to ten, how well do you think a couple of military police in the early 1940s would react to a black woman walking up to them, asking them to let her into a secured military installation?

<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor worried_speaking>>
Max: Meta, where are you?

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad>>
MsMeta: I’m outside the gates of the Justice City Naval Shipyard. They’re guarded, but…Arachdroid can fly.

<<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor angry>>
Max: Forget that. Find another way in. How high is the wall?

<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: Normally, it wouldn’t be a problem, but I can’t jump as high as I usually can…I don’t know why. If I wanted to get past it, I’d need to find something close to my height to get up on.

-> “WALK AWAY”
    <<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
    MsMeta: You’re right, forget this. I’m going to find another way in. I just need to find something about my height, then I can jump over that wall no problem…
-> “FIGHT”
    <<#SetExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
    Max: Do not do that. Bad, bad idea. I know you could take these dudes down, but we have to get Alex out of the past with as little collateral damage as possible.

MsMeta: You know, I just happened to be passing by, and I saw a suspicious-looking armored individual go flying over the wall into the shipyard...
MP1: ...
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad>>
MsMeta: Isn’t that bad news for a secured installation?
MP1: ...
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling_closed>>
MsMeta: Might even be worth you two brave soldiers, uh, going and investigating?
MP1: Miss, I don’t know what kind of thrill you’re getting out of this, but I wasn’t born yesterday, and I’m not here to have fun.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor blinking>>
MsMeta: ...I’ll just be going, then.

MP1: Superhero, right?
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: ...
MP2: Either that or you got lost on the way to chorus girl auditions, hur hur...
MP1: Shaddap, Clarence.
MP1: Look, miss, I know the drill, now that superheroes and costumed vigilantes and whatnot are popular, every gal in Justice City thinks a wild getup is gonna turn her into Lady Heart or the Crimson Fury.
MP1: But this ain’t playtime. This is a military installation, not a stage for some kid’s heroics. You ain’t Meta Man; leave the guarding and protecting to the US Army, honey.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor angry>>
MsMeta: ...
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smirking>>
MsMeta: You know what? You’re absolutely right. This kind of thing should be left to the Army. 
MP1: I’m glad you’ve seen reason, miss.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
MsMeta: I certainly am too.

Max: ...so I’ve been running some calculations, and if you go back and punch that guy in his dumb, condescending face, there isn't really that much of a historical ripple effect...
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: I appreciate it, Max, but. I'm used to it.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor blinking>>
MsMeta: I'll just do what I always do and...find another way in.

MsMeta: ...you dumbass kid, Backdraft isn’t just a random stupid Nazi!

MsMeta: Hey, uh, Max?  You know them better than me, what would lure them into the open?  Should I...dab or something?

Backdraft: Well now, I can’t say I’m too sorry for the opportunity to get a word in edgewise, now that you’ve hung up the ole’ Ameche.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad>>
MsMeta: ...oh no.
<<#SetExpression BackdraftDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
Backdraft: Oh yes. If you and your chatty friends keep crashing around the shipyard making a scene, dollface, that’s going to put a real damper on the big show I have planned for these bucketheads and fuddy-duddies today.
<<#SetExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad_speaking>>
MsMeta: You're Backdraft.
<<#SetExpression BackdraftDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
Backdraft: My reputation precedes me!  I’m flattered...but not too flattered to kill you.  Sayonara, sugar.  Shame to ruin a pretty face, but I can’t have you spoiling the fireworks.
